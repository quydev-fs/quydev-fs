## Hi there 👋 I'm quydev-fs (Tran Duc Quy)

## About me
I'm Tran Duc Quy, a 15-year-old hobbyist developer who loves retro tech, especially the Windows 95 aesthetic.  
I enjoy experimenting with low-level systems, lightweight environments, and anything that feels nostalgic but still fun to hack on.

## What I'm working on
- Building small tools and experiments for Linux, Android, and Termux
- Creating retro-inspired interfaces and utilities (like TermuxMusic95, a Winamp-styled music player)
- Exploring C++, Python, and system-level tinkering
- Maintaining random side projects that probably shouldn’t work, but somehow do

## Interests
- Old-school UI design (Win95, Motif, classic desktops)
- Minimalist and efficient tools
- Home-server experiments on Android devices
- Audio, media players, and lightweight UI frameworks

## Goals
- Learn more about system programming and OS-level architecture  
- Build more polished retro-styled apps that run on modern devices  
- Keep improving my projects and pushing weird ideas into reality
